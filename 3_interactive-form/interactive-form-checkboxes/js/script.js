 * Once loaded in the browser, you'll see two lists of checkboxes on the page 
 * Users should only be able to select one item from each section 
 * Currently, they can select as many as they want  
 * Your job is to prevent this by listening for a user click on the checkboxes
 * Then disabling or enabling all the possibilities except the one the user just clicked
 * Follow the code and instructional comments below to complete this exercise

  // YOUR CODE GOES HERE!!! Do the steps below to complete this challenge

  // 1) Create a variable named clicked to store the checkbox input that was just clicked
  //    - `e.target` will be helpful here

  // 2) Create a variable named clickedType to store the `data-type` attribute of the checkbox that was just clicked
  //    - the `getAttribute` method will be helpful here

  // 3) Log out the two variables you just created to confirm their values

  // 4) Loop over the checkbox input elements
    // 5) In the loop, create a variable named `checkboxType` to store the `data-type` attribute of the `checkboxes[i]` in the loop's current iteration = `checkboxes[i].getAttribute('data-type');`
    
    // 6) Create an `if` statement to check which items to disable/enable.  The if statement needs two conditions: 
    //    - We only want to disable/enable the item if it has the same 'data-ype' as the item that was checked/unchecked, 
    //    - So check if the checkboxType and the clickedType variables equal
    //    AND
    //    - We don't want to disable/enable the checkbox that was just clicked
    //    - So check that the clicked checkbox is not the checkbox in the loop's current iteration
    //    - These two conditions will look something like this - `(clickedType === checkboxType && clicked !== checkboxes[i])`

      // 7) In the `if` statement, create an `if/else` statement to check if the clicked checkbox is checked or unchecked
      //    - That condition will look something like this - `(clicked.checked)`;
      // 8) If the `clicked` checkbox is `checked`, use dot notation to set the `disabled` property of `checkboxes[i]` to true
      // 9) Else, set the `disabled` property of `checkboxes[i]` to false


  /* Helpful log statement to test that the listener is working - feel free to delete this or comment it out */
  console.log("The checkboxes' change event listener is functional!");
